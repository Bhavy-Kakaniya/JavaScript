📝 Simple Todo List
  A lightweight and user-friendly Todo List built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  It allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks — all while saving them in Local Storage so that tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

🚀 Features
  ✅ Add Tasks – Type a new task and click Add or press Enter to save it.
  ✏️ Edit Tasks – Double-click a task to edit its text.
  ✔️ Mark as Complete – Use the checkbox to mark tasks as completed (adds a strike-through effect).
  ❌ Delete Tasks – Click the Delete button to remove a task from the list.
  💾 Local Storage Support – All tasks are saved automatically, even after closing or refreshing the page.

💡 How It Works
  When you open the page, the app loads saved todos from localStorage.
  You can add new todos using the input box.
  Each todo item has: 
    A checkbox to toggle completion.
    A text span to display and edit the task.
    A Delete button to remove it.
    All changes are automatically saved to localStorage.

🖱️ Usage
  Open index.html in your browser.
  Type your task in the input field.
  Press Enter or click Add.
  To mark a task as complete, check the box.
  To edit a task, double-click the text.
  To delete a task, click Delete.
